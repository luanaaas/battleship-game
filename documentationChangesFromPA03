The code from PA 03 was changed starting with the Coord class. We made a new constructor in Coord that only takes in
the parameters of x and y values. In the Ship class, we also made a new constructor which has parameters of Coord start,
 int length, and Dir direction for a single ship. This made it much easier to transition to the our implementation of
 BattleSalvo to the server’s implementation. The SalvoGame and Proxy dealer implements the Controller Interface— so now
 they both inherent the run() method which runs both games. The Driver class now can handle taking in command line
 arguments to run the server or take in zero command line arguments and run the BattleSalvo game. Finally,
 we had to fix our ordering of width the height because our implementation of the x and y axis were different
 from the server’s.
